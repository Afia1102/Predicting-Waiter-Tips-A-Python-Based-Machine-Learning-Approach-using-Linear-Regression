Waiter Tips Prediction using Linear Regression:
This project aims to predict the tips given to waiters in a restaurant using a linear regression machine learning model. The dataset used for this analysis is "tips.csv".


Introduction:
Tipping waiters for serving food depends on various factors such as the total bill paid, the number of people at a table, the day of the week, the gender of the person paying the bill, whether the person is a smoker or not, and the time of the meal (lunch or dinner). This project analyzes these factors and builds a machine learning model to predict the tips given to waiters.

Dataset Information:
The dataset "tips.csv" contains the following columns:

total_bill: Total bill amount,
tip: Tip amount,
sex: Gender of the person paying the bill (Male/Female),
smoker: Smoking status (Yes/No),
day: Day of the week (Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thur, Fri, Sat),
time: Time of the meal (Lunch/Dinner),
size: Size of the party.
Analysis and Visualization:
Various visualizations are created to analyze the relationship between tips and different factors such as total bill, number of people, day of the week, gender, smoking status, and meal time.

Data Preprocessing:
Categorical values are transformed into numerical values for model training. Null values are checked and handled if present. Descriptive statistics of the data are analyzed.

Model Training:
The dataset is split into training and testing sets. A linear regression model is trained using the training data.

Model Evaluation:
The performance of the trained model is evaluated using the testing data. 

Predictions:
The trained model is used to make predictions on new data. Users can input values for total bill, gender, smoking status, day, time, and party size to get the predicted tip amount.

Dependencies:
NumPy,
pandas,
plotly,
scikit-learn.
